## 👋 Hello, I'm Samuel Ojetunde

🚀 **Aspiring Data Engineer | Data Analyst | Financial Systems Specialist**

I am a data professional with a background in financial services, currently evolving my expertise into Data Engineering. I thrive on building systems that don't just "show" data, but move and transform it efficiently.

#### **💼 Professional Experience & Impact**

**Financial Securities Automation:**

**The Challenge:** Reporting for Bonds, OMO, and Treasury Bills was trapped in manual Excel sheets, causing high latency and errors.

**The Build:** Engineered a robust SQL Server ETL pipeline to centralize fragmented security data.

**The Result: **⚡ Reduced reporting turnaround from hours to seconds and significantly improved data integrity.
